## Swiss Genomics Association

This readme is found at `.swissgenomicsassociation/README.md`.

The **Swiss Genomics Association** is a national collaboration of volunteer experts from academia, hospitals, government, and industry.
Our goal is to define **open, evidence-based standards** for the responsible use of genomics in human health, precision medicine, and research.

We meet to identify and prioritise key topics of national importance. Each topic is developed through expert discussion, literature review, and coordination with international partners who use or contribute to the resulting standards.

Our outputs include **white papers, guidelines, and reference materials** that support consistent and credible genomic practice across Switzerland.

### Repository structure

All work is organised across two types of repositories:

* The **main website repository** (`swissgenomicsassociation.github.io`) publishes the official releases from these projects for open access.
* **Project repositories** (e.g. `mendelian_disease_interpretation`) contain the source code, analyses, and LaTeX used to produce manuscripts or datasets.

During the website build, release files (for example, PDFs or datasets) are synchronised automatically to
`assets/release/<project_name>/latest/`, making them directly available on the public site.
